  abstract={Systems are methods are provided for processing multiple input objectives by a reinforcement learning agent. The method may include: instantiating a reinforcement learning agent that maintains a reinforcement learning neural network and generates, according to outputs of the reinforcement learning neural network, signals for communicating task requests; receiving a plurality of input data representing a plurality of user objectives associated with a task request; generating, based on the reinforcement learning neural network and the plurality of input data, an action output for generating a signal for communicating the task request; computing a reward based on the action output and the plurality of input data; and updating the reinforcement learning neural network based on the reward.},
