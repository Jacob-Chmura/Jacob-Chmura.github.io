I have just begun my M.Sc. Computer science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Nicolas Le Roux](https://nicolas.le-roux.name/) and [Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/).

I have spent the last 4 years working as a machine learning engineer in [deep reinforcement learning at RBC](https://www.rbccm.com/en/expertise/electronic-trading/ai-trading.page) where I had the opportunity to lead the research, architecture and development of an end-to-end system that adresses the [order routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_order_routing). Before that, I developed a [patented multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for personalized trading](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230316088A1/en?oq=18%2f130776) that enables few-shot adaptation to client trading preferences.

Before RBC, I was a researcher at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), applying machine learning to problems in cancer genomics. I published an information-theoretic dynamic programming algorithm that segments the genome based on regional mutation density patterns, reducing the number of mutations required to discriminate cancer types.

My long-term goal is to build embodied decision-making agents that emulate human-level generality, inspired by the recent advances of [foundation models](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/13/what-are-foundation-models/). I am also fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and computer systems and building ML software that scales.
