I'm currently working in [applied deep reinforcement learning at RBC](https://www.rbccm.com/en/expertise/electronic-trading/ai-trading.page).

My primary research interests are statistical decision theory, representation learning, and optimization. In particular, I am interested in how [compression based objectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360.pdf) can give rise to representations that improve sample efficiency and accelerate exploration. 

I am also fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and systems,  designing a runtime that supports efficient training and inference of large-scale machine learning models in production.
